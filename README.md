#Meme-Competitions #Memes

We have changed our meming Terms and Conditions for the Meme Competitions. 

We have decided to move to a weekly 50 DAI competition to increase the amount of winners and make it more fun. 

The number of submissions will be unlimited and need to be posted in our Discord Channel Memes. Join here: https://discord.gg/FfEhsVk

We will not be offering anymore NFTs for Memes awards.
